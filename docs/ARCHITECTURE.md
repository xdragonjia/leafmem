# LeafMem Architecture

LeafMem is a layered memory subsystem for AI agents. It keeps durable records, compressed working state, and task-local context separate, then composes them at recall time.

## Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Stored as |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 长期记忆（Palace） | Durable long-term memory records | `memory_items` |
| Active memory | Compressed current context and reusable experience | `active_documents` |
| Task context | Per-task transcript entries, rolling summary, and decisions | `task_context*` tables |
| Retrieval | Optional vector / QMD retrieval on top of palace records | built-in scoring, vector store, or QMD |

## Layered Recall Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Query["New query"] --> Active["Read active context and experience"]
  Query --> Task["Build task window"]
  Query --> Palace["Palace recall"]
  Query --> Retrieval["Retrieval stack"]

  Active --> Merge["Merge layers"]
  Task --> Merge
  Palace --> Merge
  Retrieval --> Merge
  Merge --> Prompt["injectedContext"]
```

The recall result can expose both prompt-ready text and structured hits. MCP `memory_recall` with `action: "recall"` keeps the full `hits[].record`, including `source`, `tags`, and `metadata`.

## Turn Capture Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Turn["User turn"] --> Proposals["Infer memory proposals"]
  Proposals --> Palace["Write durable palace records"]
  Turn --> Task["Append task entries"]
  Task --> Summary["Update task rolling summary"]
  Turn --> Active["Distill active context"]
```

Session-flush wrappers can delay active/task distillation until the host knows the session is ending. This keeps per-turn overhead low for tool-heavy coding agents.

## SQLite Schema

Default local MCP storage path: `~/.leafmem/memory.sqlite`

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `memory_items` | Palace records with scope, kind, content, summary, confidence, importance, source, tags, metadata, timestamps |
| `memory_items_fts` | FTS5 full-text index for palace records |
| `active_documents` | Active `context` and `experience` documents by scope |
| `task_context` | Task metadata |
| `task_context_entries` | Ordered task transcript entries |
| `task_context_state` | Rolling summary per task |
| `task_context_bookmarks` | Decisions and task bookmarks |
| `entities` | Lightweight entity records |
| `entity_links` | Entity to memory links |
| `entity_relations` | Entity graph edges |

The schema is created automatically on first connection. SQLite runs with WAL mode and foreign keys enabled.

## Scope Model

Memory records are scoped so recall can merge broad and narrow context without mixing unrelated projects.

Supported scope types:

```text
agent | session | user | task | document | project | repo
```

For project-aware platform usage, repo scope is project-qualified internally. For agent setup, LeafMem intentionally keeps MCP recall broad by default so agents can share one user memory store, while durable writes can still use `agent:<id>` scopes.

## Storage Boundaries

- Builtin palace search loads scoped records into memory for scoring. It is intended for small to medium local stores.
- Larger collections should use the retrieval stack with remote embeddings or QMD.
- Active memory is stored in SQLite. Markdown bridge adapters mirror durable memory files for host compatibility.
- Generic adapters stay thin. Host-specific wrappers should reuse the host's model/provider/auth where possible.
